# TMP-prediction
A computational pipeline for predicting thermostable (thermophilic) proteins using machine learning, sequence-based features, and structural properties. This repository contains code for feature extraction from protein sequences, model training, evaluation, and inference to identify proteins that are likely to be thermostable.
